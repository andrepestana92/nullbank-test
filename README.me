#About#
This project is written in Scala language, using the _sbt_ build tool (http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html).
To run this project you need to execute the sbt command and type run <INPUT_FILE> in its interactive console.
The program will calculate the points for the people listed in the file. After that, you can type a new conexion and the program will recalculate the new points. When you are ready to leave this interactive mode, you can type 'Enter' instead of a new conexion.
